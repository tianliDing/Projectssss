 Building in Commands:
 
 - cd <path>
     
     //to change the current working directory of the shell to <path>
     
 - !history
     
     //to print out each command in the history in order. 
     
 - #<n>
 
     //to print and execute the nth command in history where n is a non-negative integer.
     
 - !<prefix>
 
     //to print and execute the last command that has the specified prefex. If no match is found, print the appropriate error   
     and do not store anything in the history. The prefix may be empty.
